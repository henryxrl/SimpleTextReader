# Config Directory

The `config/` directory contains shared configuration files that provide centralized constants, settings, and reusable configurations for both the frontend and backend. These configurations ensure consistency across the application and reduce duplication of commonly used settings.

---

## Purpose

The `config/` directory is designed to:

- Centralize shared settings, constants, and configurations for frontend and backend use.
- Ensure consistency in application behavior across environments.
- Simplify maintenance by storing reusable configuration logic in one location.

---

## Examples

### 1. **`shared-config.js`**

**Purpose**:
Contains shared constants and settings required by both frontend and backend environments.

**Examples**:

- Stores reusable configurations, such as API endpoints, feature flags, and default settings.
- Enables both client and server to reference the same configuration without duplication.
- Provides an easy way to adjust settings globally.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Centralize Configurations**:
   - Add all shared constants and settings here to maintain consistency across the application.
   - Avoid hardcoding environment-specific values elsewhere in the codebase.

2. **Keep It Lightweight**:
   - Avoid adding complex logic or dependencies to configuration files. Focus on storing static settings and constants.

3. **Document Configuration Options**:
   - Clearly document the purpose and usage of each configuration property to make maintenance easier for all contributors.

4. **Environment-Specific Configurations**:
   - If environment-specific settings are required, consider integrating environment variables (e.g., `process.env`) with shared configurations.

---

## Notes

- The `config/` directory plays a crucial role in ensuring consistency across the frontend and backend.
- When introducing new settings or constants that are shared across environments, add them to `shared-config.js` and document their purpose.
- Keep this directory focused on shared configurations; avoid mixing environment-specific or unrelated logic.
