## Important Updates

### v1.0

Now SimpleTextReader is also available as a Chrome/Firefox extension with two distinct versions:

1. Regular version: Upon clicking the icon from the extension list, the full UI appears, providing the same functionality as the complete SimpleTextReader web app.

2. No-UI version: Once activated, <s>any URL ending in ".txt" (including local text files that were dragged and dropped in the browser, `file://*.txt`) will be automatically opened using SimpleTextReader.</s> However, please be aware that this version might have slower performance when opening large text files. The delay is due to the browser's default behavior of loading the entire file at once, which cannot be modified.

    **NOTE: Starting from v1.2.6, No-UI version only opens local txt files, i.e., `file://*.txt`.**

### v1.1

Now SimpleTextReader can be installed as a PWA in supported browsers (Chromium-based browsers such as Chrome and Edge).

### v1.2

Enable dark mode.

</div>

### v1.4

1. Enable local bookshelf. Special thanks to [cataerogong](https://github.com/cataerogong) for their coding support and contributions!

    [1] Now you can easily add multiple text files to the bookshelf by selecting or drag-and-dropping;

    [2] Auto generation of book cover arts based on the user's chosen colors;

    [3] Books are sorted as the following:

        a. dIn-progress books: sorted by last opened time;

        b. Unread books: sort by file names;

        c. Finished books: sort by last opened time.

    [4] Show reading progress and other detailed information for each book; add special stylings of book covers for both unread books and finished books;

    [5] The height of the bookshelf automatically adjusts according to the number of books;

    [6] In reading mode, click on the bookshelf icon in the bottom-right corner (or press the `Esc` key) to return to the bookshelf.

2. Improve the user interface language setting, which now automatically adapts to the browser's language preferences. If your browser languages include Chinese, the UI language will be set to Chinese; otherwise, it will default to English.

    [1] When reading, the UI language is set to match the language of the book for better reading experience.

3. Optimized for ultrawide monitors.

4. Other stability bug fixes.

***NOTE: The bookshelf feature is incompatible with Firefox's private browsing mode and will be automatically deactivated.***
