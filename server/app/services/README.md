# Services Directory

The `services/` directory contains the core business logic and reusable utility functions for the backend application. Each service module is focused on a specific area of functionality, ensuring clean separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Contents

### 1. `library-service.js`

**Purpose**: Provides services for managing and accessing the cloud library.

### 2. `token-service.js`

**Purpose**: Manages tokens for secure file access across the application.

**Examples**:

- Generating unique access tokens for specific file types (e.g., books, fonts).
- Validating tokens to ensure secure and authorized access.
- Supporting token-based authentication for protected resources.

**Features**:

- Implements cryptographic operations for secure token management.
- Integrates with configuration settings for token behavior (e.g., expiry times).

## Notes

**Service Logic**: Services are designed to be reusable across multiple routes and middleware, avoiding duplication and promoting consistency.

**Best Practices**:

- Keep services focused on a single responsibility.
- Avoid embedding HTTP-specific logic; delegate request and response handling to routes or middleware.
- Ensure all file operations and token management follow security best practices to prevent vulnerabilities.
