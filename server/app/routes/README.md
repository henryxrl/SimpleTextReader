# Routes Directory

The `routes/` directory defines all API endpoints for client-server communication. Each file in this directory organizes routes by functionality, ensuring a clean and modular structure. Routes are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and delegating logic to appropriate services or middleware.

## Contents

### 1. `api.js`

**Purpose**: Manages root-level API routes and health checks.

**Examples**:

- Providing API status endpoints for monitoring service availability.
- Serving system health information for debugging or external monitoring tools.

**Features**:

- Verifies service readiness and operational status.
- Integrates middleware for error handling and authentication where needed.

### 2. `library.js`

**Purpose**: Handles all library-related API endpoints and associated middleware.

**Examples**:

- Fetching the list of available books in the library.
- Streaming or retrieving the content of specific books.
- Managing access tokens for secure interactions with the library.
- Validating user sessions for protected operations.

**Features**:

- Provides a robust API for interacting with the library system.
- Implements middleware for authentication, security, and error handling.

## Notes

**API Design**: Routes are organized to follow RESTful conventions where possible, ensuring clarity and consistency.

**Best Practices**:

- Keep route definitions simple and delegate business logic to service modules.
- Use middleware to handle cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, validation, and error handling.
- Document all API endpoints clearly for frontend integration and external use.
