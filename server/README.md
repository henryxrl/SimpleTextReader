# Server Directory

The top-level directory serves as the root of the backend portion of the project. It contains essential files and subdirectories that organize the application's logic, dependencies, and assets. This directory is structured to ensure modularity, maintainability, and clarity.

---

## Structure Overview

### 1. `app/`

**Purpose**: Contains the primary source code of the application, organized into subdirectories for clarity and scalability.

**Responsibilities**:

- Houses all configurations, middleware, services, and routes.

- Serves as the core directory where all application logic resides.

**Notes**:

- Each subdirectory has a specific purpose (e.g., routes handle API endpoints, services contain business logic).

- Refer to the README files in `app/` and its subdirectories for more detailed explanations.

---

### 2. `books/`

**Purpose**: Houses the text files (cloud library) that the application processes.

**Responsibilities**:

- Serves as a storage location for raw `.txt` files to be analyzed or manipulated by the application.

**Notes**:

- Ensure that all `.txt` files intended for processing are placed in this directory.

- Avoid modifying files in this directory manually if they are being actively processed.

---

### 3. `node_modules/`

**Purpose**: Contains all the third-party dependencies required by the project, installed via the Node.js package manager.

**Responsibilities**:

- Provides libraries and modules defined in the `package.json` file.

- Enables the application to run efficiently by reusing external code.

**Notes**:

- This folder is automatically managed by `npm` and should not be modified manually.

- To install dependencies, use the command:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

---

### 4. `package.json`

**Purpose**: The metadata file for the Node.js project.

**Responsibilities**:

- Specifies the projectâ€™s dependencies, scripts, and metadata.

- Defines key scripts to run or develop the application:
  - `npm install`: Installs all dependencies.
  - `npm start`: Starts the application in production mode.
  - `npm run dev`: Runs the application in development mode with live-reloading (if configured with a tool like `nodemon`).

**Notes**:

- Use `npm install` to set up the project and install necessary dependencies.
- To start the application:
  - For development:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

  - For production:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

---

### 5. `package-lock.json`

**Purpose**: A snapshot of the dependency tree to ensure consistent installs across environments.

**Responsibilities**:

- Locks the exact versions of dependencies and sub-dependencies.

- Ensures reproducibility of the application across different setups.

**Notes**:

- Do not edit this file manually.

- This file is automatically updated when running `npm install`.

---

## Best Practices

1. **File Organization**:

   - Keep static assets like `.txt` files in the `books/` directory.

   - Place all application logic in the `app/` directory to maintain separation of concerns.

2. **Dependency Management**:

   - Use `npm install` to manage dependencies, and avoid modifying `node_modules/` manually.

3. **Running the Application**:

   - For development (with live-reloading):

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

   - For production (optimized for deployment):

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

4. **Consistency**:

   - Follow consistent naming conventions for files and directories.

   - Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes to `package.json` and other configuration files.

5. **Documentation**:

   - Each subdirectory should include a `README.md` for detailed explanations of its purpose and structure.

## Notes

- The root directory acts as the foundation of the backend project.
- Always run the following commands when setting up the project:
  1. Install dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

  2. Start the application:
     - For development:

       ```bash
       npm run dev
       ```

     - For production:

       ```bash
       npm start
       ```
