# modules Directory

The `modules/` directory contains the core application logic, organized into specific subdirectories to maintain a modular and scalable structure. Each subdirectory represents a distinct area of functionality or responsibility.

---

## Subdirectories

### 1. `components/`

**Purpose**: Contains reusable UI components that are shared across different features or pages.

**Examples**:

- `custom-color-picker.js`: A customizable color picker component.

- `dropdown-selector.js`: A dropdown menu component for selecting options.

- `cover-generator.js`: A utility for generating book cover visuals.

---

### 2. `features/`

**Purpose**: Houses high-level features or flows of the application. These files typically combine multiple components, utilities, and business logic to implement specific features.

**Examples**:

- `bookshelf.js`: Manages the bookshelf view and its interactions.

- `reader.js`: Implements the main text reading functionality.

- `settings.js`: Manages user settings and configurations.

---

### 3. `file/`

**Purpose**: Handles file-related logic, such as processing and loading files into the application.

**Examples**:

- `file-processor.js`: Processes file inputs, such as uploaded books or documents.

- `fileload-callback.js`: Manages callbacks after a file is successfully loaded.

- `file-processor-worker.js`: A worker script for handling intensive file processing tasks in the background.

---

### 4. `text/`

**Purpose**: Responsible for text parsing, processing, and rendering logic.

**Examples**:

- `text-processor.js`: Handles the parsing and processing of text content.

- `pagination-calculator.js`: Calculates pagination for the text content in the reader.

- `regex-rules.js`: Defines regular expressions for parsing and cleaning up text.

## Best Practices

1. **Separation of Concerns**:

    - Keep each subdirectory focused on a specific area of functionality.

    - Avoid mixing unrelated logic within the same module.

2. **Reusability**:

    - Place reusable UI components in `components/` and avoid duplicating code in `features/`.

3. **Scalability**:

    - As the application grows, consider splitting large modules or adding new subdirectories to keep the codebase organized.

4. **Documentation**:
    - Include inline comments and, where necessary, additional documentation for complex modules or logic.

## Notes

- The `modules/` directory is the heart of the application, containing both core functionality and high-level features.

- Each subdirectory is designed to be modular, making it easier to debug, extend, or refactor specific parts of the application.
