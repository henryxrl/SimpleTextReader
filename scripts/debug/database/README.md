# Database

The `database/` directory contains multiple versions of the database implementation in the `bookshelf.js` file. These files are preserved to document the development process, assist with debugging, and enable comparison across versions.

## Purpose

The `bookshelf.js` script is designed to interact with database, storing and retrieving book related data and information.

## Contents

- **Versioned Files**: Each version is clearly named to indicate its purpose, version, or timestamp for easy identification.

- **Debugging Reference**: Files may include experimental code, comments, or notes added during development for better context.

- **Feature Development**: Iterations reflect enhancements, bug fixes, and optimization efforts over time.

## How to Use

- **Review Changes**: Examine differences between versions to understand how the script evolved.

- **Debugging**: Revert to earlier versions to test or troubleshoot potential issues.

- **Feature Inspiration**: Refer to past iterations for ideas or reference when implementing new functionality.

## Note

For production use, always rely on the most recent stable version of `bookshelf.js` and `db-manager.js`, unless explicitly testing or debugging with older versions.
