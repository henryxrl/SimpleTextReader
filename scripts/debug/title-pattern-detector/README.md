# Title Pattern Detector

The `title-pattern-detector/` directory stores multiple iterations of the `title-pattern-detector.js` file. These versions are preserved for review, debugging, and comparison purposes to track changes and improvements over time.

## Purpose

The `title-pattern-detector.js` script is designed to dynamically detect and construct patterns for identifying chapter titles in text files, even if the patterns are novel or unexpected. This directory provides a history of its development to aid in debugging and feature enhancements.

## Contents

- **Versioned Files**: Each file is named to indicate its version or timestamp for easy identification.

- **Debugging Reference**: Previous versions may include comments, experimental code, or debugging logs to provide context for changes.

## How to Use

- **Review Changes**: Compare versions to understand how the script has evolved and identify specific updates or bug fixes.

- **Debugging**: Revert to earlier versions if a recent change introduces issues.

- **Improvement Tracking**: Use the versions as a reference when implementing new features or optimizing the script.

## Note

Always ensure youâ€™re using the latest stable version unless explicitly debugging or testing with older versions.
